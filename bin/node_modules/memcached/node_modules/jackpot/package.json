It does not need to be\nreleased, as it will allocate connections based on their readyState / write\nabilities.\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar ConnectionPool = require('jackpot');\n\n// First argument: size of the connection pool.\n// Second argument: optional connection factory.\n// Third argument: optional options.\nvar pool = new ConnectionPool(100);\n```\n\nThe following options can be configured:\n\n- `retries` the amount of retries the pull method should do.\n- `factor` exponential backoff factor.\n- `min` minimal delay for the backoff.\n- `max` maximum delay for the backoff.\n- `randomize` randomize the connection.\n\n```js\nvar pool = new ConnectionPool(100, {\n  min: 100\n  max: 50000\n});\n```\n\nBut you can also set the properties:\n\n```js\n// you can optionally boost the amount of retries after you have\n// constructed a new instance\npool.retries = 5 // allow 5 failures for the #pull method\n```\n\nYou can set the required factory at the contructor but also through a helper\nmethod:\n\n```js\n// every connection pool requires a factory which is used to generate / setup\n// the initial net.Connection\n//\n// it should return a new net.Connection instance..\npool.factory(function () {\n  return net.connect(port, host)\n});\n```\n\nThere are 2 ways to retrieve a connection, using `allocate`:\n\n``js`\n// now that the pool is setup we can allocate a connection, the allocate\n// requires a callback as it can be async..\npool.allocate(function (err, connection) {\n  // error: when we failed to get a connection\n  // connection: the allocated net.connection if there isn't an error\n});\n```\n\nAnd `pull`;\n\n```js\n// in addition to the #allocate method, there is also the pull method, which is\n// fault tolerant wrapper around the allocate function as it can give back an\n// error if the pool is full, so the pull will then retry to get a new\nconnection.pull(function (err, connection) {\n  // same arguments as the #allocate method\n});\n```\n\nAnd some misc methods:\n\n```js\n// call pool.free if you want to free connections from the pool, the arugment\n// you supply is the amount of connections you want to keep\npool.free(10); // keep only 10 healthy connections kill the rest.\n\n// kill the whole connection pool:\npool.end();\n```\n\nFor more API information, fork this repo and add more.. or look at the test\nfile.\n\n## LICENSE (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Observe.it (http://observe.it) <opensource@observe.it>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: \n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
